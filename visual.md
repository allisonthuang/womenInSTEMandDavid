## Project Ideation ðŸš€
Our project is meant to provide a home to the athletics information for Del Norte. We are planning to create a website similar to the football and volleyball page on the Del Norte Website for the lacross team store their team information. It's going to have calendars, schedules, registration, information for parents, sponsorships, about us, staff, rosters, photo uploads, search bars, contacts and donation information. Users can sign up. Our sponsor for this project is Mrs. Sullivan. <br>

## Requirements from our sponsor 
Mrs. Sullivan: Some of their athletics teams have websites. Like [football](https://www.dnfootball.com/) and [volleyball](https://dnhsboysvolleyball.com/). 
- Lacrosse foundation... She said she'd be happy with something like volleyball's site.
- Wants somewhere to store photos and basically all the information like scheudules, rosters, donations, and etc.
- Work with her on hosting

## Visual Thoughts ðŸ–¥
Visually it should look black and green/blue to match the school colors and the lacross team uniforms.<br>
